# Password Manager for Chrome

### NOTE: 
This project is a **prove of concept** / **sample application** for a chromium based web-browser and originated form the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpuomoEUbgQ

This extension **does not provide secure password storage** (as of 18th March 2022) and therefore it is not recommended to be used for anything other than educational purposes.
